              <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Background</h2>
                <p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) defines ecological sites as 
                  “a distinctive kind of land with specific physical characteristics that differs from other kinds of land in its ability 
                  to produce a distinctive kind and amount of vegetation” (USDA–NRCS, 2006). Ecological sites determine not only the 
                  ecological potential of a site, but also how a site can respond to natural disturbance and management actions. Ecological sites 
                  have been delineated for many areas using physical and biotic features and are linked to soil map units. Soils, climate, 
                  hydrology, geology, physiographic features, plant species occurrences, plant community composition, annual biomass production, 
                  and plant-wildlife interactions all contribute to the properties of ecological sites. Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs) describe 
                  the underlying factors associated with a specific ecological site, as well as different ecological states within a given site based 
                  on factors such as grazing, fire, drought, and other management actions. For an example of an ESD, see EDIT Jornada.
                </p>

              <div id="section3" class="prose p-2 scroll-section">
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Ecological Site Summary</h2>
              <p>Using ecological monitoring data, the overall status of an Ecological Site can be summarized into an Ecological Site Summary (ESS). 
                At the site level, ecological site summaries generated from monitoring data can tell us about the condition and health of ecological 
                sites based on indicators such as cover by structure and functional group, species dominance, species occurrences, canopy gap 
                measurements, and soil stability measurements. These indicators can help inform the user of the ecological state of a given plot or 
                overall site (i.e. shrubland state vs. grassland state). Identifying the ecological state allows us to not only determine the degree of 
                departure from the corresponding reference ecological states, but also to inform management and restoration actions accordingly by 
                determining the best pathway to a less degraded state. For more on state and transition models (STMs), see Bestelmeyer et al., 2017.
                 A major data source for developing these summaries is the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Program along with the Landscape 
                 Monitoring Framework (LMF). AIM and LMF include almost 25,000 plots throughout the western United States (see AIM Data Portal) stored 
                 in the Terrestrial AIM Database (TerrADat). Data garnered from AIM and LMF plots is both generalizable and scalable and thus applicable
                  to management decisions across multiple disciplines at both local and national levels.

              <h2 style="font-weight: bold">ESS Tool</h2>
                <p>An Ecological Site Summary (ESS) tool has been developed to help users visualize the overall status of their region of interest 
                  within a specific ecological site, or across an ecological site group. This information can be summarized within a given administrative
                   state or across political boundaries for landscape scale analysis. Users can query summary tables, download full or filtered summary 
                   tables to view in Excel, explore interactive figures, and download static figures for their own use. 
                </p><p>
                   This ESS information can be included in decision making processes for Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managers, as it can help inform
                    land use plans, grazing permit renewals, shrub or invasive species treatments, and/or seed menu development for ecological restoration
                    and reclamation. As new data become available or lines of inquiry shift, the summary tables and report can be easily updated.

              <div id="section4" class="prose p-2 scroll-section">
              <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Using the ESS Tool</h2>
                <p>This tool generates many tables and figures that can be queried, filtered, and downloaded to meet your management and reporting needs. 
                  Multiple output types are used to meet multiple needs, so select the most relevant and useful output. In cases where ESDs are not 
                  developed, grouping AIM data by other features can provide similar information, and potentially lead to the development of new ESDs. 
                  For this purpose, it may be informative to group data by features such as biophysical indicators, location, or project. Spatial 
                  groupings may also be beneficial if you want to compare data in the same ecological site across multiple management units such as
                  grazing allotments, pastures, prescribed burn areas, etc. The report you generate can be customized to select and compare indicators
                  by both spatial and non-spatial groupings.  
                </p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Step 1: Access the tool</h3>
                <p>To use the ESS Tool, navigate to https://www.stone-env.net/esst/. Click “Get Started” to pull up a map and query the data.
                  Use the tab to expand and collapse the form and map in the application. 
                </p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Step 2: Select attributes and indicators</h3>
                <p> Use the attribute buttons at the top of the form to filter the data by “Soil Attributes”, “Plant Attributes”, “Erosion Indicators”, 
                  or “Indicators of Rangeland Health”. Select indicators under one or more attributes to use in your query. You will be able to sort your 
                  data by indicator and set benchmarks in a later step. 
                  Click "Add New Row” to add a statement to your query group. Use the dropdown under “Property” to add an indicator to your query statement,
                  choose an operator, then input a value to complete the statement. Add additional rows to your group to complete your query statements.
                  Click “X” to the right of any row to remove it from the group. 
                </p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Step 3: Select an area of interest (AOI)</h3>
                <p>Click “Add AOI” for options to include select the area of interest to include in your query: 
                  Draw Polygon: Use the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons on the map. After selecting "Add AOI” > “Draw Polygon”, click on the map to start drawing. 
                  Continue clicking until the polygon is your intended size and shape. You may add additional separate polygons to the same query group. 
                  Project: Use this option to select one or more projects using a Project Key, ESD, MLRA, or Ecoregion Level #3. ESDs and MLRAs are described in 
                  more detail in EDIT Jornada. Ecoregions can be found on the EPA’s website.  
                  Upload Shapefile: This option allows you to upload a shapefile from your device into the tool. 
                  Note: you may combine any of these AOI options in one query. For example, you can select an MLRA and a shapefile or an ESD, a 
                  shapefile, and a hand-drawn polygon.  
                </p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Step 4: Manage query group and geodata</h3>
                <p> Select the + sign to add a query group. Choose a property from the Property dropdown menu. You may also choose an operator 
                  and a value. You may add multiple properties to the same query group by clicking the + sign. You may name your group using the filter 
                  button and selecting Rename Group. 
                  To create an additional query group you may select “Add New Group” to start an empty new query group or you may create a duplicate of your existing 
                  query group by using the Query Group Settings button and selecting “Clone Group”. This clone can then be modified or renamed. 
                  You may also delete groups by using the filter button and selecting “Delete Group.” You may delete queries within a group by clicking the X at the 
                  end of the line.  
                  Rename your query group using the Query Group Settings. After clicking the settings button, choose “Rename Group”. 
                  After selecting your query group property settings and area of interest, use the [sliders icon] button and select Manage GeoData. Use the GeoData 
                  Manager to inspect your AOI selections and the number of unique sites they each contain. Click a table row to zoom the map to that selection's 
                  extent. Bu default, unique sites in each selection are added together in the query. To subtract a selection's sites from the query, click “Exclude” under
                  the Toggle Selection. To remove a selection, click the “X” Destroy button. Remove all selections with the Clear All button. Press the Close button to 
                  return to the Query Form. 
                </p>
              <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Step 5: View and interact with query results</h3>
                <p>Once you have set your query group properties and areas of interest, click Submit to run the query. 
                  Errors: too many sites, no data available 
                  After the query runs, click the Results tab. In Results, click the Graph and Table tabs to view the data.

  Ecological site: “is a distinctive kind of land with specific soil and physical characteristics that differ from other kinds of land in its ability 
  to produce distinctive kinds and amounts of vegetation, and in its ability to respond similarly to management actions and natural disturbances” 
  (USDA-NRCS, 2006). 

  Ecoregion: a major ecosystem defined by distinctive geography and receiving uniform solar radiation and moisture. They are areas where ecosystems 
  (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. Designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, 
  assessment, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components, ecoregions denote areas of similarity in the mosaic of biotic, abiotic, terrestrial, 
  and aquatic ecosystem components with humans being considered as part of the biota. Ecoregions are identified by analyzing the patterns and composition
  of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Omernik 1987, 1995). These phenomena include
  geology, landforms, soils, vegetation, climate, land use, wildlife, and hydrology.  (More details here: https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions)
      
  Natural Disturbance: Disturbances are events, like tornados, wildfires or floods that cause marked changes to the impacted area. Examples of ecological 
  disturbances include fires, landslides, flooding, windstorms and insect and pest outbreaks. Disturbances often come in the form of short-term or 
  temporary changes to the landscape but can have very significant ecosystem impacts. These events often act quickly but with great impact and thereby 
  are able to promote changes to the physical structure of the system. For example, a fire burning over a mature forest results in a different composition
   of species after the disturbance event. Other types of disturbances may occur over longer, persistent timeframes that also can promote changes to 
   the biodiversity or health of the system. (More details here: https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/disturbances-and-stressors).  
  
  Management Actions:  
  
  Physiographic features: the physical features and processes of landforms and their relation to geologic structures, including the soils, topography,
   land slope and aspect, and local climate, that influence the form and species composition of plant communities. 
  
  Plant community composition: a description of vegetation in a fixed area by the species present and their abundance. 
  (More details here: https://climexhandbook.w.uib.no/2019/11/04/plant-community-composition/) 
  
  Annual biomass production: the amount of organic plant matter produced in a given area over the course of a year.  
  
  Plant-wildlife interactions: Relationships between the plants and animals in a given ecosystem. These relationships include predation, 
  parasitism, commensalism, or mutualism and do not require direct physical contact. Important plant-wildlife interactions are pollination, 
  seed dispersal, and herbivory. The plants and animals have co-evolved these adaptive mechanisms to maximize the chance of survival.  
  
  State-and-Transition Model: “These models synthesize literature and informal knowledge tied to particular ecological sites to distinguish changes
   in vegetation and soils that are easily reversible versus changes that are subject to thresholds beyond which reversal is costly or impossible. 
   The models describe all possible states, community phases (i.e., easily-reversible variants of states), and transitions between communities and 
   states. Transitions contain information about mechanisms, triggers, thresholds, and indicators of threshold development.”
