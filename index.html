              <p>
                The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
                Conservation Service (NRCS) defines ecological sites as “a
                distinctive kind of land with specific physical characteristics
                that differs from other kinds of land in its ability to produce
                a distinctive kind and amount of vegetation” (<a
                  href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/landuse/rangepasture/?cid=stelprdb1068392"
                  >USDA–NRCS, 2006</a
                >). Ecological sites determine not only the ecological potential
                of a site, but also how a site can respond to natural
                disturbance and management actions. Ecological sites have been
                delineated for many areas using physical and biotic features and
                are linked to soil map units. Soils, climate, hydrology,
                geology, physiographic features, plants species occurrences,
                plant community composition, annual biomass production, and
                plant-wildlife interactions all contribute to the proerties of
                ecological sites. Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs) describe
                the underlying factors associated with a specific ecological
                site, as well as different ecological states within a given site
                based on factors such as grazing, fire, drought, and other
                management actions. For an example of an ESD, see

              <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Ecological Site Summary</h2>
              <p>
                Using ecological monitoring data, the overall status of an
                Ecological Site can be summarized into an Ecological Site
                Summary (ESS). At the site level, ecological site summaries
                generated from monitoring data can tell us about the condition
                and health of ecological sites based on indicators such as cover
                by structure and functional group, species dominance, species
                occurrences, canopy gap measurements, and soil stability
                measurements. These indicators can help inform the user of the
                ecological state of a given plot or overall site
                (i.e.&nbsp;shrubland state vs.&nbsp;grassland state).
                Identifying the ecological state allows us to not only determine
                the degree of departure from the corresponding reference
                ecological states, but also to inform management and restoration
                actions accordingly by determining the best pathway to a less
                degraded state. For more on state and transition models (STMs),
                see see

                  >Bestelmeyer et al., 2017</a
                >. A major data source for developing these summaries is the
                Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Program along with
                the Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF). AIM and LMF include
                almost 25,000 plots throughout the western United States (<em

                >

                  >AIM Data Portal</a
                >) stored in the Terrestrial AIM Database (TerrADat). Data
                garnered from AIM and LMF plots is both generalizable and
                scalable and thus applicable to management decisions across
                multiple disciplines at both local and national levels.

              <p>
                An Ecological Site Summary (ESS) tool has been developed to help
                users visualize the overall status of their region of interest
                within a specific ecological site, or across an ecological site
                group. This information can be summarized within a given
                administrative state or across political boundaries for
                landscape scale analysis. Ecological site summaries are
                generated using an R Markdown script with an interactive HTML
                output in which users can query summary tables, download full or
                filtered summary tables to view in Excel, explore interactive
                figures, and download static figures for their own use.
              </p>
              <p>
                This report is an automated process and can be continually
                updated as new data becomes available each year or as lines of
                inquiry shift. This ESS information can be included in decision
                making processes for BLM managers, as it can help inform land
                use plans, grazing permit renewals, shrub or invasive species
                treatments, and/or seed menu development for ecological
                restoration and reclamation.

              <p class="pl-4 border-l-2">
                In cases where ESDs are not developed, grouping AIM data by
                other features can provide similar information, and potentially
                lead to the development of new ESDs. For this purpose, it may be
                informative to group data by features such as watershed units,
                soil map units, or biophysical settings. Spatial groupings may
                also be beneficial if you want to compare data that’s in the
                same ecological site but across multiple management units such
                as grazing allotments, pastures, prescribed burn areas, etc.
                Grouping indicators by other spatial attributes is available in
                a customized report on page two of this

                  Download the ESS_Tool folder from the AIM Sharepoint that
                  contains the ESS_Tool project (ESS_Tool.Rproj), RMarkdown
                  script (ESS_Tool.Rmd), report rending script (RenderReport.R)
