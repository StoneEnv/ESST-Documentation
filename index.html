                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service <a
                    href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/" class="underline"><abbr title="Natural Resources Conservation Service">&#40;NRCS&#41;</abbr></a> defines ecological
                  sites as
                  "a distinctive kind of land with specific physical characteristics that differs from other kinds of
                  land in its ability
                  to produce a distinctive kind and amount of vegetation" <a
                    href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/las-cruces-nm/range-management-research/docs/ecological-site-descriptions-introduction/"
                    class="underline"><abbr title="United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service">&#40;USDA-NRCS&#41;</abbr></a>.
                  Ecological sites determine not only the
                  ecological potential of a site, but also how a site can respond to natural disturbance and
                  management actions. Ecological sites
                  have been delineated for many areas using physical and biotic features and are linked to soil map
                  units. Soils, climate, hydrology, geology, physiographic features, plant species occurrences, plant community composition,
                  annual biomass production, and plant-wildlife interactions all contribute to the properties of ecological sites. Ecological
                  Site Descriptions <abbr title="Ecological Site Descriptions">&#40;ESDs&#41;</abbr> describe
                  the underlying factors associated with a specific ecological site, as well as different ecological
                  states within a given site based
                  on factors such as grazing, fire, drought, and other management actions. For an example of an ESD,

                <h3>Ecological Sites</h3>
                <p>Using ecological monitoring data, the overall status of an ecological site can be summarized into
                  an Ecological Site Summary <abbr title="Ecological Site Summary">&#40;ESS&#41;</abbr>.
                  At the site level, ecological site summaries generated from monitoring data can tell us about the
                  condition and health of ecological sites based on indicators such as structure and functional group, species dominance, species
                  occurrences, canopy gap
                  measurements, and soil stability measurements. These indicators can help inform the user of the
                  ecological state of a given plot or
                  study site &#40;i.e. shrubland state vs. grassland state&#41;. Identifying the ecological state allows users
                  to not only determine the degree of
                  departure from the corresponding reference ecological states, but also to inform management and
                  restoration actions by
                  determining the best pathway to a less degraded state. These shifts between states can be modeled
                  with a State and Transition Model <abbr title="State and Transition Model">&#40;STM&#41;</abbr>.
                  For more information on state and transition models, see
                  <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27988/1002009.pdf?sequence=1#page=313"

                <p>A major data source for developing these summaries is the

                    <abbr title="Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring">&#40;AIM&#41;</abbr> Program</a> along with the Landscape

                  Data garnered from AIM and LMF plots is both generalizable and scalable and thus applicable
                  to management decisions across multiple disciplines at both local and national levels.
                </p>
                <p>The Ecological Indicators Summary <abbr title="Ecological indicators Summary">&#40;EIS&#41;</abbr> tool has been developed to help users visualize the
                  overall status of their region of interest
                  within a specific ecological site, or across an ecological site group. This information can be
                  summarized within a given administrative
                  state or across political boundaries for landscape scale analysis. Users can query summary tables,
                  download full or filtered summary
                  tables to view in Excel, explore interactive figures, and download static figures for their own use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This EIS information can be included in decision making processes for <a href="https://www.blm.gov/"
                    class="underline">Bureau of Land Management <abbr title="Bureau of Land Management">&#40;BLM&#41;</abbr></a> managers, as it can help

                  development for ecological restoration

                <h3>Using the EIS Tool</h3>
                <p class="mb-8">This tool generates many tables and figures that can be queried, filtered, and
                  downloaded to meet your management and reporting needs.
                  Multiple output types are used to meet multiple needs, so select the most relevant and useful
                  output. In cases where ESDs are not
                  developed, grouping AIM data by other features can provide similar information, and potentially lead
                  to the development of new ESDs.
                  For this purpose, it may be informative to group data by features such as biophysical indicators,
                  location, or project. Spatial
                  groupings may also be beneficial if you want to compare data in the same ecological site across
                  multiple management units such as
                  grazing allotments, pastures, prescribed burn areas, etc. The report you generate can be customized
                  to select and compare indicators
                  by both spatial and non-spatial groupings.

                    generally similar. Designed to serve
                    as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem
                    components, ecoregions

                    components with humans

                  <li><b>Natural Disturbance: </b>Disturbances are events, like tornados, wildfires or floods that
                    cause marked changes to the impacted
                    area. Examples of ecological disturbances include fires, landslides, flooding, windstorms and
                    insect and pest outbreaks.
                    Disturbances often come in the form of short-term or temporary changes to the landscape but can
                    have very significant
                    ecosystem impacts. These events often act quickly but with great impact and thereby
                    are able to promote changes to the physical structure of the system. For example, a fire burning
                    over a mature forest
                    results in a different composition of species after the disturbance event. Other types of
                    disturbances may occur over
                    longer, persistent timeframes that also can promote changes to the biodiversity or health of the
                    system.

                    predation, parasitism, commensalism, or mutualism and do not require direct physical contact.
                    Important plant-wildlife
                    interactions are pollination, seed dispersal, and herbivory. The plants and animals have

                    to distinguish changes in vegetation and soils that are easily reversible versus changes that are
                    subject to thresholds beyond which reversal is
                    costly or impossible. The models describe all possible states, community phases &#40;i.e.,
                    easily-reversible variants of states&#41;,
                    and transitions between communities and states. Transitions contain information about mechanisms,

                    shapefiles can contain
                    geometry errors or other misinformation that prevents them from functioning properly. If you are
                    using a zipped shapefile and are not
                    returned results, please consider the following:<br>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                    <li>The shapefile must be saved as a .zip file and contain the .shp, .shx, and .prj files of the
                      shapefile. Only include one shapefile per .zip file.</li>
                    <li>Shapefiles may not work with all web browsers. Please use Google Chrome for best results.</li>

                    <li>Shapefiles with complex geometries &#40;i.e., polygons with many vertices&#41; or many features will
                      result in an error. Please reduce the number of features or <a
