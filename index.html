              <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/"; style ="color: blue">(NRCS)</a> defines ecological sites as 
                  "a distinctive kind of land with specific physical characteristics that differs from other kinds of land in its ability 
                  to produce a distinctive kind and amount of vegetation" <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/las-cruces-nm/range-management-research/docs/ecological-site-descriptions-introduction/"; style ="color: blue">(USDA-NRCS)</a>. 
                  Ecological sites determine not only the 
                  ecological potential of a site, but also how a site can respond to natural disturbance and management actions. Ecological sites 
                  have been delineated for many areas using physical and biotic features and are linked to soil map units. Soils, climate, 
                  hydrology, geology, physiographic features, plant species occurrences, plant community composition, annual biomass production, 
                  and plant-wildlife interactions all contribute to the properties of ecological sites. Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs) describe 
                  the underlying factors associated with a specific ecological site, as well as different ecological states within a given site based 
                  on factors such as grazing, fire, drought, and other management actions. For an example of an ESD, see 
                  <a href= "https://edit.jornada.nmsu.edu/"; style ="color: blue">EDIT Jornada.</a>

              <h3>Ecological Site Summary</h3>
              <p>Using ecological monitoring data, the overall status of an Ecological Site can be summarized into an Ecological Site Summary (ESS). 
                At the site level, ecological site summaries generated from monitoring data can tell us about the condition and health of ecological 
                sites based on indicators such as cover by structure and functional group, species dominance, species occurrences, canopy gap 
                measurements, and soil stability measurements. These indicators can help inform the user of the ecological state of a given plot or 
                overall site (i.e. shrubland state vs. grassland state). Identifying the ecological state allows us to not only determine the degree of 
                departure from the corresponding reference ecological states, but also to inform management and restoration actions accordingly by 
                determining the best pathway to a less degraded state. For more on state and transition models (STMs), see 
                <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27988/1002009.pdf?sequence=1#page=313"; style ="color: blue">Bestelmeyer et al., 2017.</a>
                 A major data source for developing these summaries is the 
                 <a href = "https://www.blm.gov/aim"; style ="color: blue">Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Program</a> along with the Landscape 
                 Monitoring Framework (LMF). AIM and LMF include almost 25,000 plots throughout the western United States (see AIM Data Portal) stored 
                 in the <a href ="https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/BLM-EGIS::blm-natl-aim-terradat-hub/about"; style ="color: blue">Terrestrial AIM Database (TerrADat).</a> 
                 Data garnered from AIM and LMF plots is both generalizable and scalable and thus applicable
                  to management decisions across multiple disciplines at both local and national levels.
                </p>
                <p>An Ecological Site Summary (ESS) tool has been developed to help users visualize the overall status of their region of interest 
                  within a specific ecological site, or across an ecological site group. This information can be summarized within a given administrative
                   state or across political boundaries for landscape scale analysis. Users can query summary tables, download full or filtered summary 
                   tables to view in Excel, explore interactive figures, and download static figures for their own use. 
                </p><p>
                   This ESS information can be included in decision making processes for <a href = "https://www.blm.gov/"; style ="color: blue">Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</a> managers, as it can help inform
                    land use plans, grazing permit renewals, shrub or invasive species treatments, and/or seed menu development for ecological restoration
                    and reclamation. As new data become available or lines of inquiry shift, the summary tables and report can be easily updated.

              <h3>Using the ESS Tool</h3>
                <p margin-bottom: 1em>This tool generates many tables and figures that can be queried, filtered, and downloaded to meet your management and reporting needs. 
                  Multiple output types are used to meet multiple needs, so select the most relevant and useful output. In cases where ESDs are not 
                  developed, grouping AIM data by other features can provide similar information, and potentially lead to the development of new ESDs. 
                  For this purpose, it may be informative to group data by features such as biophysical indicators, location, or project. Spatial 
                  groupings may also be beneficial if you want to compare data in the same ecological site across multiple management units such as
                  grazing allotments, pastures, prescribed burn areas, etc. The report you generate can be customized to select and compare indicators
                  by both spatial and non-spatial groupings.  
                </p>

                  Disturbances often come in the form of short-term or temporary changes to the landscape but can have very significant 
                  ecosystem impacts. These events often act quickly but with great impact and thereby 
                  are able to promote changes to the physical structure of the system. For example, a fire burning over a mature forest 
                  results in a different composition of species after the disturbance event. Other types of disturbances may occur over 
                  longer, persistent timeframes that also can promote changes to the biodiversity or health of the system.

                <li><b>Management Actions:</b>decisions and actions made under an approach to maintaining the health and productivity of an ecosystem while sustaining appropriate
                human uses. More details can be found in <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204697000947"; style = "color: blue"> Brussard et al., 1998.</a></li> 
              <li><b>Physiographic features: </b>the physical features and processes of landforms and their relation to geologic structures, 
                  including the soils, topography, land slope and aspect, and local climate, that influence the form and species 
                  composition of plant communities.</li>
                <li> <b>Plant community composition: </b>a description of vegetation in a fixed area by the species present and their abundance.

                <li><b>Annual biomass production: </b>the amount of organic plant matter produced in a given area over the course of a year.</li>
                <li><b>Plant-wildlife interactions:</b> Relationships between the plants and animals in a given ecosystem. These relationships include 
                  predation, parasitism, commensalism, or mutualism and do not require direct physical contact. Important plant-wildlife 
                  interactions are pollination, seed dispersal, and herbivory. The plants and animals have co-evolved these adaptive mechanisms 
                  to maximize the chance of survival.</li>
                <li><b>State-and-Transition Model: </b>"These models synthesize literature and informal knowledge tied to particular ecological sites 
                  to distinguish changes
                  in vegetation and soils that are easily reversible versus changes that are subject to thresholds beyond which reversal is 
                  costly or impossible. The models describe all possible states, community phases (i.e., easily-reversible variants of states), 
                  and transitions between communities and states. Transitions contain information about mechanisms, triggers, thresholds, 
                  and indicators of threshold development." More details can be found on the <a href = "https://jornada.nmsu.edu/knowledge-systems/esd"; style = "color: blue"> Jornada website.</a></li>
                <li><b>Ecological restoration and reclamation: </b>The process of assisting the recovery of severely degraded ecosystems to benefit 
                  native biota through the establishment of habitats, populations, communities, or ecosystems that are similar, but not 
                  necessarily identical to surrounding and naturally occurring ecosystems.
